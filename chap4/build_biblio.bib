    abstract = {Abstract In this chapter, the support vector machines (svm) methods are studied. We first point out the origin and popularity of these methods and then we define the hyperplane concept which is the key for building these methods. We derive methods related to svm: the maximum margin classifier and the support vector classifier. We describe the derivation of the svm along with some kernel functions that are fundamental for building the different kernels methods that are allowed in svm. We explain how the svm for binary response variables can be expanded for categorical response variables and give examples of svm for binary and categorical response variables with plant breeding data for genomic selection. Finally, general issues for adopting the svm methodology for continuous response variables are provided, and some examples of svm for continuous response variables for genomic prediction are described.},
