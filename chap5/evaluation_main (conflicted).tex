\chapter{Evaluation}
% take a step back and put your results from 4 into context. 
This chapter critically examines the machine learning models conceived and partially implemented
in the previous chapter.
Table~\ref*{tab:evaluation_criteria} shows an overview of the evaluated criteria. These are
structured according to the Goal-Question-Metric approach.

The quality metrics are oriented on the quality model from
\cite[]{siebert_constructionqualitymodel_}, which is based on the ISO/IEC 9126 standard for the
evaluation of software quality. \cite[]{iso9126_softwareproductqualitymodel_}. The standard was
changed to fit the requirements of machine learning models.

The metrics of the goal \textit{Robustness} where original only defined for classification models
and therefore needed to be changed.

\section{DP1: Appropriateness}
% How well does the model type fit the current task?
% Prerequisites for model type


\section{DP2: Correctness}
% Ability of the model to perform the current task measured on the development dataset and the
% runtime dataset
The model must be able to perform well on the selected task.
To measure the correctness of the model, the metrics MAE, MSE and RMSE are used.
In the formulas \ref{eq:mae}, \ref{eq:mse} and \ref{eq:rmse} the variable $e_i$ is the prediction
error which is the difference between the predicted value by the model the actual value.
$y_i$ is the actual value and $n$ is the number of samples in the testing data set.

The mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE) are the most commonly used metrics for
evaluating the performance of regression models. \paragraph*{Mean Absolute Error (MAE)}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mae}
    MAE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |e_i|
\end{equation}

The MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and the actual values.
The MSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE.

\paragraph*{Mean Squared Error (MSE)}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:mse}
    MSE = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} e^2
\end{equation}

The RMSE is the square root of the MSE. The RMSE is the most popular metric for evaluating the
performance of regression models. The RMSE is interpretable in the same units as the response
variable. The RMSE is more sensitive to outliers than the MAE.
The MAE is the average of the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values.
Additionally the $R^2$ was added to the overview. The $R^2$ is a statistical measure of how close
the data are to the fitted regression line. It is also known as the coefficient of determination,
or the coefficient of multiple determination for multiple regression. The value of the $R^2$ is
the percentage of the response variable variation that is explained by a linear model.

\paragraph*{Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:rmse}
    RMSE = \sqrt{MSE}
\end{equation}

For a full overview about the performance all three metrics are sued for the evaluation.

% \subsection{Goal Hierarchy}

\section{Relevance}
% Does the model achieve a good bias-variance tradeoff? Which means neither overfitting or
% unterfitting the data.

% Bias variane trade-off 

The model is relevant if it is able to achieve a good bias-variance tradeoff. This means neither
overfitting or unterfitting the data.
The variance of cross-validation scores gives an idea on how stable the model's performance is
when it is trained an evaluated on different subsets of data.
% Chat GPT 
If the variance is low, it means that the model's performance is relatively consistent across
different folds, and you can have more confidence in the evaluation. On the other hand, if the
variance is high, it means that the model's performance can vary significantly depending on which
data points are used as the test set, and you should be more cautious when interpreting the results.

variance of cross-validation. The $R^2$ was calculated with the formula~\ref{eq:r2}.

\section{Robustness}
% Ability of the model to outliers, noise and other data quality issues
% Variance of cross-validation, fit

% Equalized Loss of Accuracy (ELA) 

% Definition of robustness
According to \cite{saez_evaluatingclassifierbehavior_2016} robustness "is the capability of an
algorithm to build models that are insensitive to data corruptions and suffer less from the
impact of noise" \cite[p. 2]{saez_evaluatingclassifierbehavior_2016}.
In this context the metric Equalized Loss of Accuracy (\ac{ELA}) was established to measure the
robustness of different machine learning models. But the \ac{ELA} is only usable for
classification models, therefore a different metric has to be found.

There are a number of ways to evaluate the performance of regression models, including mean
squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean squared error (RMSE). You can use
these measures to compare the performance of different regression models on a given task. Also
the $R^2$ can be used to measure the robustness of the model.

As mentioned in section~\ref{sec:dataset_exploration}~dataset~exploration the dataset has a high
quality with no outliers and no missing values.
Therefore, these data quality issues will be added to the dataset to measure the robustness of
the model.

\subsection{Missing Data}
When applying the model to real-world data, there is a chance that some values are missing. Two
possible scenarios are possible:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Missing Missing Die Openings}: There is no data available about a metal with a
    \item certain thickness and die opening ($Vt$-combination). Reasons could be that the metal
    \item is not used in the industry or the data was never measured.
    \item \textbf{Missing values}: There is data for the $Vt$ combination but some values are
    \item missing because of general data quality issues.
    \item \textbf{Outliers}: There are values that are not in the range of the dataset. Reasons
    \item could be that the data was measured incorrectly.
\end{enumerate}

To measure all three of these scenarios, three different tests where created. The first test
measures the robustness of the model.

\subsubsection*{1. Missing Die Openings}
As can be seen Figure~\ref{fig:train_test_split} of the test and training dataset, all possible
$Vt$ combinations are present in the dataset, also
This is not the case in real-world data. Therefore, the robustness of the model has to be
measured with missing $Vt$ combinations.

Note: In previous sections all samples with the die opening 30 where used as testing set. This
makes sense fore reasons explained in Section~\ref{sec:model-training} but this approach is not
feasible for measuring the robustness of the model.

A robust model should be able to perform well even when certain die openings are not present in
the data. To accurately evaluate its ability to generalize to new die openings, it is important
to ensure that a specific die opening is not used for both training and testing.
Therefore, \textit{leave one group out cross-validation} was used.
The dataset was split into groups, each group contains all samples with the same die opening
which results in 5 groups with $V 10, 20, 30, 40$ and $50$.

To evaluate the robustness the average loss of accuracy is calculated for each group.

For evaluation the mean $R^2$ is calculated for each group. The mean $R^2$ is calculated with the
formula~\ref{eq:r2}.


To calculate the loss off accuracy the models trained with missing $Vt$ combinations were
compared to the model trained with all data.
The difference between the \ac{MSE} of the models was calculated. The total loss of accuracy was
calculated by averaging the difference of the \ac{MSE} of the models.

\subsubsection*{2. Missing values}
Another data quality issue that can occur in real-world data are missing values.
Different to the missing die openings data quality error here not all data with a certain die
opening is missing, but some data points are missing.

In the used dataset each die opening has an evenly distributed punch penetration values, which
has a positive impact on the performance of the models.

\subsubsection*{Finding a Method}
To test the robustness of the model to missing values, iteratively more samples are removed from
the dataset and the models are trained and tested with the remaining data.

The most accurate way to do that would be \textit{Leave P Out Cross-Validation}, which creates
all possible training and test set while removing p samples from the complete set. This means
that overlapping tests sets will be created which results in a high number of iterations which is
costly.
Even with the used 380 samples this would result in to many iterations, which is not feasible.

That is the reason \textit{K-Fold Cross Validation} with an increasing number of folds was used.
The minimum number of folds is 2, which means that the model is trained with half of the data and
tested with half of the data.
The maximum number of folds is the number of samples in the dataset, which means that the model
is trained with only 1 sample and tested with the remaining samples.

To measure the robustness of the model the \textit{Average Loss} (AL) is calculated with
Equation~\ref{eq:average_loss}, where $n$ is the number of samples in the dataset.

\subsubsection*{Implementation of the Method}
The number of folds of the \textit{K-Fold Cross Validation} is iteratively increased from 2 to
$n$, which is the number of samples in the dataset.
For each fold the \ac{RMSE} is calculated and the mean \ac{RMSE} is calculated across all folds.

Afterwards, the mean \ac{RMSE} for each cross-validation was calculated, and the difference
between all mean \ac{RMSE} was defined as the loss of accuracy. The total loss of accuracy was
calculated by averaging the difference of the \ac{RMSE} of the models.

The difference between all mean \ac{RMSE} was defined as the loss of accuracy. The total loss of
accuracy was calculated by averaging the difference of the \ac{RMSE} of the models.

The calculation of the average loss of accuracy is shown in Equation~\ref{eq:average_loss}.

\paragraph*{Average Loss}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:average_loss}
    AL = \frac{\sum_{k=2}^{n} \frac{loss_{RF} - loss_{SVM}}{loss_{RFj}}}{n-1}
\end{equation}

Note: Imputations of missing values can be used to equalize the loss of accuracy. This is not
done in this thesis because the goal is to measure the robustness of the model to missing values.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{average_loss}
    \caption{Average Loss Example}
    \label{fig:average_loss}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection*{3. Outliers and wrong data}
To measure the robustness of the model, outliers were added to the data. The outliers were added
to the data in the following way:


\subsubsection*{Noise}
\textit{Not sure if I want to measure that.}


Note: This process of measuring the robustness of the model differs from the approach used by
\cite{siebert_constructionqualitymodel_} and \cite{saez_evaluatingclassifierbehavior_2016}.

\section{Stability}
% Does the artifact generate repeatable results when trained on different data?
% Leave-one-out cross-validation stability 
Stability is the ability of the model to generate repeatable results when trained on different
data. \cite[p. 16]{siebert_constructionqualitymodel_}
To measure the stability of the model, leave-one-out cross-validation (\ac{LOOCV}) was used.


\paragraph*{Leave-one-out cross-validation \ac{LOOCV}}

\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:loo}
    LOO = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{\hat{y}_i} |y_i - \hat{y}_i|
\end{equation}

\ac{LOOCV} is another method that is commonly used. It can be thought of as a type of k-fold
cross-validation where each fold consists of a single sample. During each split, a single data
point is selected to be the test set. This method can be very time-consuming, especially for
large datasets, but it may provide more accurate estimates for small datasets. \cite[p.
257-258]{muller_introductionmachinelearning_2016}

The variance of all \ac{CV} scores is calculated with the formula~\ref{eq:variance_cross}.
A low variance indicates that the model is stable which means that the model's performance is
consistent across different training and testing sets. This is generally a desirable property for
a model to have, as it suggest that the model ist not overfitting to the training data and is
able to generalize well to unseen data.

On the other hand, a high variances indicates an unstable model and is a sign of overfitting, as
the model may be to closely tied to the training data and not generalize well to unseen data.

\section{Interpretability and Explainability}
% How well can the model be explained?
% Complexity measures (e.g., no. of parameters, depth)
% R^2 value ???? 



Interpretability is linked to the model. A model is said to be interpretable if we can interpret
directly the impact of its parameters on the outcome. Among interpretable models, one can for
example mention : Linear and logistic regression, Lasso and Ridge regressions, Decision trees, etc.

Explainability can be applied to any model, even models that are not interpretable.
Explainability is the extent to which we can interpret the outcome and the internal mechanics of
an algorithm.


Interpretability refers to the ease with which humans can understand and make sense of the
decisions made by a trained machine learning model. \cite[p.
16]{siebert_constructionqualitymodel_} It is the extent to which the inner workings of the model
and the reasoning behind its predictions can be understood by human users. Good interpretability
is important because it allows users to trust and rely on the model, and it can also help with
debugging and improving the model.
To measure the interpretability of the model, the following metrics are used:

\paragraph*{The number of parameters in the model}
Measured as integer, representing the total number of parameters in the model.
Models with more parameters are generally more complex and more prone to overfitting

\paragraph*{Depth of the model}
Measured as an integer, representing the number of layers in the model.
A model with many layers, is generally more complex than a shallow network with fewer layers.

\paragraph*{Inference time}
Measured in milliseconds. Time it takes to make a prediction.
A model that takes longer to make predictions may be more complex than a model that is able to
make predictions more quickly.

\paragraph*{Level of interpretability}
\textit{Harder to measure but some ideas: }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Partial dependence plots: These plots show the relationship between a single
    \item feature and the model's predictions, holding all other features constant. This can help
    \item to identify which features are most important for the model and how they influence the
    \item predictions.}
    \item \textit{LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations): This is a method for
    \item explaining the predictions of any black-box classifier. It works by training an
    \item interpretable model locally around the prediction of interest, and using this local
    \item model to explain the prediction of the black-box model.}
    \item \textit{SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations): This is another method for explaining the
    \item predictions of black-box models. It works by assigning importance to each feature based
    \item on its contribution to the model's prediction.}

\end{itemize}


\paragraph*{Amount of training data required}
\textit{Will be the same for all models so this metric may not be used.}

\textit{Explanation of the results}


\section{Resource utilization}
% How much resources are required to train and run the model?
% Training time, runtime, storage space

To measure the resource utilization of the model, the following metrics are used:

% From Copilot
\paragraph*{Training time}
Measured in seconds. Refers to the time it takes to train the model.
Training a model requires resources such as memory, CPU, and GPU, therefore the longer it takes
to train a model, the more resources are required. According to resources utilization a shorter
training time is desirable.

The training time is measured using the \texttt{time.time} function in python. The function
returns the time in seconds since the epoch. The time is measured before and after the model is
fitted. The difference between the two times is the training time.

\paragraph*{Runtime}
Measured in milliseconds. It refers to the time it takes to make a prediction on data once it has
been trained.
It is an important measure not only for real-world application but also a faster runtime uses
less resources and is therefore more efficient.

The runtime is measured using the \texttt{time.time}  function in python. On value is picked out
of the test set and the time is measured before and after the prediction is made. The difference
between the two times is the runtime.

\paragraph*{Storage space}
Measured in kilobytes. It refers to the amount of storage space required to store the model.
The more storage space required to store the model, the more resources are required to store it.
Therefore, a smaller storage space is desirable.
